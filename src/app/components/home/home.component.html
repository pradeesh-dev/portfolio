                I’m a <strong>Software Developer</strong> with experience in
                backend development, cloud integrations, and research-driven problem-solving.
                My journey started in Research & Development, exploring innovative solutions
                before transitioning into product development and client projects.

                I’ve worked with <strong>Java, Spring Boot, API integrations, and large-scale data migrations</strong>,
                focusing on optimizing workflows and building efficient solutions. With a strong foundation in
                software architecture and problem-solving, I enjoy tackling complex challenges
                and continuously learning new technologies.

                Beyond development, I have an interest in UI/UX design, ensuring that
                functionality meets great user experience. Whether it's designing scalable systems or
                researching cutting-edge solutions, I’m always driven to create impactful and efficient software.
